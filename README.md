An extension to p5play that adds professional game development features.

> This is a work in progress. Please support me on [Patreon][] to help me finish it! No documented features yet, I will announce them as they are added.

Coming soon, [Patreon][] supporters will get access to:

- an iOS app template for publishing games to the App Store
- JavaScript functions for integrating native ads into your games

Eventually I'd like to add:

- the ability to disable or customize the "made with p5play" loading screen
- multiplayer support
