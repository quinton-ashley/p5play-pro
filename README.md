An extension to p5play that adds professional game development features.

Coming soon, [Patreon][] supporters will get access to:

- an iOS app template for publishing games to the App Store
- JavaScript functions for integrating native ads into your games

Eventually I'd like to add:

- the ability to disable or customize the "made with p5play" loading screen
- multiplayer support
